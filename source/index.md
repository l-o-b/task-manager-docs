Task Manager Service
====================

Service provides the basic support for a multi-tasking pool of workers, their manager as well as the business users that are submitting tasks that need to be done.

# /tasks

## POST /tasks

```javascript
{ 
  title : 'email me some positive thoughts. I am feeling down!'
      title or short description of the task
      displayed prominently in task listings and such
      some listing display shorter portions if you put a long title
      expect to be shown in many places with ellipsis

      required 
      
  description  :  ''
      longer/full description of the task
      typically displayed when showing a single task

      optional 
      empty 

  deadline  : 
      deadline for the task
      datetime in whatever is the standard form an API

      optional  
      default to 24 hrs from submission time
      negative or 0 means asap and changes into now (plus + estimate)

  
  estimate : 300  //assuming that the units is "seconds"
      submitter expectation of time that it would take to finish the task
      in whatever is the standard unit for time apis

      optional
      default => 1 hr

     
  owner :  "odysseas@ezhome.com"
      who this task is for
      using email because it makes the API more easy to use..everyone has the email
      quite possibly internally the app should always be recording user-id  but allow
      incoming user references to be email based and outgoing user references are also 
      converted into the "user's current email" for api friendlyness

      optional
      default : the currently authenticated user
      
  tags : 'tag1 tag2' # string of tags separated by whitespace
      optional 
      tags are used as the catch-all instead of structured filtering (list-ing) for now
      
  state : current task state
      one of these string values:
        'queued'
        'worked on'
        'deleted'
        'done'
}
```

In response the POST call returns the newly created object
which includes filled in defaulted empty attributes, (equiv to GET /tasks/5768)

The above should be support the use case of the add command.

## GET /tasks?status=status&amp;owner=owner&amp;n=N
Returns list of N tasks with the given status and owner (status must be one of the following strings: 'queued/active/suspended/completed/deleted')
```javascript
[
    {
        description: 'description string',
        deadline: date,
        estimate: ,
        owner: 'owner email',
        properties: {key: value},
        state: 'queued/worked on/deleted/done',
        _id: task_id,
        _created_by: 'creator email',
        _created_on: date,
        _last_modified_on: date,
        _worked_by: 'worker email',
        _worked_on: date,
        _work_status: 'active/suspended/success/failure',
        _completed_on: date,
        _tags: 'first_tag second_tag'
    },
    ...
]
```

## /tasks/{task_id}

### GET /tasks/{task_id}
Returns task information
```javascript
{   
  title : 'email me some positive thoughts. I am feeling down!'
  description  :  
  deadline  : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z'
  estimate : 300
  owner :  'odysseas@ezhome.com'
  tags : [ tag1 tag2 ]

  /* system attrs */
  _id : task_id
  _created_by : 'odysseas@ezhome.com'    
  _created_on : '2015-11-20T17:26:33Z' 
  _last_modified_on : '2015-11-20T17:26:33Z'
  _state : 'queued'
  _worked_by : 'mary@ezhome.com'            # if the task is under the control of a worker which worker that is
  _worked_on : '2015-11-20T17:26:33Z'       # if the task is under the control of a worker .. when it was last grabbed */
  _work_status : suspended or active        # if the task is under the control of a worker 
  _completion_status : success or failure   # if the test is completed 
  _completed_on : '2015-11-20T17:26:33Z'    # if the test is completed 

}
```
### PUT /tasks/{task_id}
```javascript
{   
  _id : 5768
  title : 'email me some positive thoughts. I am feeling down!'
  description  :  
  deadline  : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z'
  estimate : 300
  owner :  'odysseas@ezhome.com'

}
```
=> returns the updated object same as GET /tasks/5768

Updating an existing task
with PUT or whatever is the right convention for the update of an existing object

Given the minimal need for this I am trying to keep the implementation as simple as possible.

For simplicity, the complete object is being replaced,
ie, if a parameter is missing we do not keep existing values, we simply follow the same defaulting 
logic that we follow on `add` to generate defaults for the missing parameters.
Also, note that for now we do not allow tag update (more complex will need tag add and tag remove functionality)

The only "business logic" is that we only allow a task to be updated if it is in `queued` state.
Descriptive error messages are generated otherwise, e.g.
```
Cannot Update. Task is  (being worked on|completed|deleted)
Task does not exist.
```
The above should be able to support the use case of update command

### DELETE /tasks/{task_id}
It sets the state to "deleted"  - which is considered a final state
Only queued tasks are allowed to be deleted

``` returns the deleted object same as GET /tasks/5768
```

Descriptive error messages are generated on error
```
Cannot Delete. Task is  (being worked on|completed)
Task does not exist.
```
### /tasks/{task_id}/purge
#### POST /tasks/{task_id}/purge
Removes task and all events for this task from database

### /tasks/{task_id}/history
#### GET /tasks/{task_id}/history

This command shows chronological history of events and some additional timing information for selected task
```javascript
{
  events : [         # complete chronoligical history of events
    { when : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z', who : 'joe@ezhome.com', what : 'grab' },
    { when : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z', who : 'joe@ezhome.com', what : 'grab' },
    { when : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z', who : 'joe@ezhome.com', what : 'grab' },
    { when : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z', who : 'joe@ezhome.com', what : 'grab' },
    { when : '2015-11-20T17:31:33Z', who : 'joe@ezhome.com', what : 'grab' },
  ]

  # some aggregates on top of the history of the events
  time_elapsed       # time since first submitted
  time_til_deadline  # 
  time_worked_on     # time the task has spent being the active task of the current worker (only if in-progress)
  time_suspended     # time the task has spent suspended by the current worker (only if in-progress)
  time_queued        # total time in the queue
  time_rejected      # total time under the control of users that eventually released the task without completing it
  times_rejected     # how many times the current task has been rejected by prior users
}
```
